"""Regression tests for media image-fetch download-size enforcement.

Before the fix, `_fetch_image_url` did `await client.get(url)` and then read
`resp.content`, so the entire response body was buffered into memory before the
20 MB limit was checked. A URL serving an unbounded body (chunked / lying
content-length) exhausted process memory even though the code believed it had a
20 MB cap. The cap must stop the download, not just reject after the fact.

These tests prove the stream stops once the limit is exceeded, using a handler
that raises if the client ever tries to read past the cap.
