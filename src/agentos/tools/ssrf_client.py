"""SSRF-guarded HTTP client: validate the address the socket actually uses.

The URL-level guards in :mod:`agentos.tools.ssrf` resolve a hostname once and
check what came back. The fetch that follows goes through ``httpx``, which
resolves the same hostname *again* when it opens the connection — so a
short-TTL (DNS-rebinding) domain can answer with a public address for the
guard's lookup and with ``169.254.169.254`` for the socket's. That is a
time-of-check/time-of-use window, and the cloud metadata endpoint sits on the
other side of it.

The fix is to remove the second resolution rather than narrow the window: a
network backend resolves the hostname itself at connect time, applies the same
policy to every address it got, and then connects to a validated **IP literal**.
The address that was checked is the address the socket uses, because nothing
resolves the name a second time.

TLS is unaffected. ``httpcore`` performs the handshake separately from the TCP
connect and passes ``server_hostname`` from the request origin (or the
``sni_hostname`` extension), never from the host it connected to — so SNI and
certificate verification still run against the origin hostname. Only the TCP
endpoint is pinned.
